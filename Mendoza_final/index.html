			<h2>Our Quest</h2>
			<p>Powerful Wielders of magic are in demand. Join up and be a Powerful Wizard Today!</p>
			<p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the
				subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing
				lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.</p>
			<p>
				A Wizard is to cherish their grimoire as it is a great power that comes with great responsibility, there
				are many other grimoires like it but that one is yours so cherish it well
			</p>

				"I was very skeptical at first, until they gave me a cool pointy hat and an orb to ponder, I always
				wanted to be a wizard after since i was little lad working on my farm i always dreamed about it. I
				watched a bunch of wizards on their cool towers summoning lightning and freezing dragons and lighting up
				the sky with a fireball and ever since then I thought it was cool, until an evil necromancer made mes
				keptical of the arts and I decided that I hated wizards until a villager introduced me to the mages here
				at this academy and I've been practicing magic ever since. sure my spells are intermediate but I'll get to
				expert level mage someday. Maybe one day i'll start my own magic school and maybe i'll hang out in the
				cool wizard tower that will be built to cast cool spells in. Maybe i'll get a pet dragon im thinking
				about a scaly green dragon that breathes fire, he doesn't have to be able to fly but it'll be cool if he
				can because then I won't have to take the wizard bus to the mart to pick up my daily soymilk".
