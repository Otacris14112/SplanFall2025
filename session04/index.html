            <p>
                A <span class="mushroom">Mushroom</span> is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically
                produced above ground on
                soil or another food source. A toadstool generally refers to a poisonous mushroom.</p>
            <blockquote>
                There are few more useful, more easily recognized, or more delicious members of the vegetable kingdom
                than the common mushroom, known botanically as Agaricus campestris (or Psalliota campestris). It grows
                in short grass in the temperate regions of all parts of the world. Many edible fungi depend upon minute
                and often obscure botanical characters for their determination, and may readily be confounded with
                worthless or poisonous species; but that is not the case with the common mushroom, for, although several
                other species of Agaricus somewhat closely approach it in form and colour, yet the true mushroom, if
                sound and freshly gathered, may be distinguished from all other fungi with great ease. It almost
                invariably grows in rich, open, breezy pastures, in places where the grass is kept short by the grazing
                of horses, herds and flocks. Although this plant is popularly termed the “meadow mushroom,” it never as
                a rule grows in meadows. It never grows in wet boggy places, never in woods, or on or about stumps of
                trees. An exceptional specimen or an uncommon variety may sometimes be seen in the above-mentioned
                abnormal places, but the best, the true, and common variety of the table is the produce of short,
                upland, wind-swept pastures. A true mushroom is never large in size; its cap very seldom exceeds 4, at
                most 5 in. in diameter. The large examples measuring from 6 to 9 or more in. across the cap belong to
                Agaricus arvensis, called from its large size and coarse texture the horse mushroom, which grows in
                meadows and damp shady places, and though generally wholesome is coarse and sometimes indigestible. The
                mushroom usually grown in gardens or hot-beds, in cellars, sheds, &c., is a distinct variety known as
                Agaricus hortensis. On being cut or broken the flesh of a true mushroom remains white or nearly so, the
                flesh of the coarser horse mushroom changes to buff or sometimes to dark brown. To summarize the
                characters of a true mushroom—it grows only in pastures; it is of small size, dry, and with unchangeable
                flesh; the cap has a frill; the gills are free from the stem, the spores brown-black or deep
                purple-black in colour, and the stem solid or slightly pithy. When all these characters are taken
                together no other mushroom-like fungus—and nearly a thousand species grow in Britain—can be confounded
                with it.

            <h3>Identification</h3>
            <p>
                Identifying what is and is not a mushroom requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure.
                Most are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiomycota" target="_blank">Basidiomycetes</a> and
                gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and
                fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the
                basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space..</p>

            <h3>Species Types</h3>
            <p>
                Typical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricales" target="_blank"> Agaricales</a>, whose type genus is Agaricus
                and type species is the field mushroom, Agaricus campestris. However in modern molecularly defined
                classifications, not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other
                gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class <span class="types">Agaricomycetes.</span> </p>
