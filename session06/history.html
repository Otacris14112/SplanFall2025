                    <p>Hooded Warlocks possess a great deal of aura that is made known to anyone in their presence. They
                        are masters of the dark arts and their hood compliments the nature of their dark magic. Although
                        they do not match the traditional style of a wizard they have created their own class of wizards
                        that still display their magical prowess. Hooded Warlocks are often seen pondering their orb and
                        maintaining their immense magic power to uncover the dark secrets of the world. A foe
                        dare not to interupt the warlock as he's pondering his awesome crystal orb, for it will be the
                        last mistake they make.</p>
