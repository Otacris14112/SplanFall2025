                    <h3>Etymology</h3>
                    <p>Both the Latin genus name Hericium and the species name erinaceus mean 'hedgehog' in Latin. This
                        is also reflected by the German name, Igel-Stachelbart (literally, 'hedgehog-goatee'), and some
                        of its common English names, such as bearded hedgehog and hedgehog mushroom.[5] It is known in
                        Japan as yamabushitake (Kanji: 山伏茸, Katakana: ヤマブシタケ) in reference to the yamabushi or mountain
                        ascetics of the syncretistic religion known as Shugendo; while in Chinese, it is known as
                        hóutóugū (simplified Chinese: 猴头菇; traditional Chinese: 猴頭菇; Jyutping: hau4 tou4 gu1) meaning
                        "monkey-head mushroom", in Korea as noru gungdeng-i beoseot (노루궁뎅이버섯) meaning "deer butt
                        mushroom", and in Europe and the United States as lion's mane.[6]</p>

                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>It has been observed that H. erinaceus can fruit intermittently for 20 years on the same dead
                        tree. It is hypothesized that H. erinaceus can survive for 40 years.[7] The mating system of H.
                        erinaceus species found in the U.S. was shown to be bifactorially heterothallic.[10]
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The monokaryotic mycelium growth of H. erinaceus is slower than dikaryotic growth and only a
                        relatively low percentage of monokaryotic cultures yield fruitbodies. Monokaryotic fruitbodies
                        are also smaller than dikaryotic fruitbodies.[7] The monokaryotic mycelium was found to produce
                        fusoid to subglobose chlamydospores of 6–8 x 8–10 μm size. These spores can stay viable for more
                        than seven years and be stored under anaerobic conditions.[citation needed] Chlamydospore
                        germination requires 30 to 52 hours, with a germination success rate of 32 to 54%.[10]

                        Spore production is highest at midday, relative to temperature increase and a decrease of
                        relative humidity. Daily trends toward lower relative humidity can favor sporulation, however,
                        levels of relative humidity that are too low do not favor high total sp

            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>Native to North America and Eurasia, the mushrooms are common during late summer and autumn on hardwoods,
                particularly American beech and maple. It is typically considered saprophytic, as it mostly feeds on
                dead trees. It can also be found on living trees, usually in association with a wound.</p>
