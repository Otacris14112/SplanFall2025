			<h2>Pointy Hat Wizard Lore</h2>

			<p>The OG founder. The most traditonal style of wizard who makes his presence known with his
				powerful spellbook filled with spells from all over the globe. The pointy wizard hat is meant to
				be a flashly look that compliments their immense power. These wizards are often seen on their
				cool wizard tower at the top of a tall mountain. He often goes to the top of his tower to cast
				lightning bolts so that he has a cool scenary to play his wizard electric guitar. </p>
			</p>
			<p>Due to their traditional image as a wise old man or wise old woman, magicians may be depicted as old,
				white-haired, and in some instances with their hair (and in the case of male wizards, beards), being
				long and majestic enough to occasionally host lurking woodland creatures. This depiction predates the
				modern fantasy genre, being derived from the traditional image of wizards such as Merlin</p>
			<p>a magician may be shown wearing a pointed hat, robes, and/or a cloak. In more modern stories, a magician
				may be dressed similarly to a stage magician, wearing a top hat and tails, with an optional cape.</p>
			<p>Wands and staves have long been used as requirements for the magician.[6]: 152  Possibly derived from
				wand-like implements used in fertility rituals, such as apotropaic wands, the earliest known instance of
				the modern magical wand was featured in the Odyssey, used by Circe to transform Odysseus's men into
				animals. Italian fairy tales put wands into the hands of powerful fairies by the Late Middle Ages.[18]
				Today, magical wands are widespread in literature and are used from Witch World to Harry Potter. In The
				Lord of the Rings, Gandalf refuses to surrender his own staff, breaking Saruman's, which strips the
				latter of his power. This dependency on a particular magical item is common, and necessary to limit the
				magician's power for the story's sake – without it, the magician's powers may be weakened or absent
				entirely.[19] In the Harry Potter universe, a wizard must expend much greater effort and concentration
				to use magic without a wand, and only a few can control magic without one; taking away a wizard's wand
				in battle essentially disarms them </p>
			</p>
			<p>Magicians normally learn spells by reading ancient tomes called grimoires, which may have magical
				properties of their own.
